# Array and Strings

# Linked List :

A linked list is a sequential list of nodes that hold data
which point to other nodes also containing data.

Graph : 

Used:

a. Used in many list, Queue & Stack implementaions 
b. Great for creating circular lists
c. can easily model real world objects such as trains
d. Used in Separate chaining, which is present certain Hashtable 
implementations to deal with hashinh collsion
e. Often used in the implementaion of adjacnecy lists of the graphs

Graph Terminilogy

Head: First node
Tail: last node
Pointer: Refernce to anothet node
Node:object conatining data and pointers

Singly vs Doubly Linked lists

Singly linked list only hold a reference to the next node. In the implementaion 
you alwyas maintian a reference to the head to the linked list and a reference to th atail node
for the quick additions/ removal

Graph 

With doubly linked list each node holds a reference to the next and previous node
In the implemention you always maintain a refernce to the head and the tail of the doubly 
linked list to do quick additions/removals from the both ends of your list.

Pros and Cons:

Singly linked list :

Pros: Uses less memory and simpler implementaion
Cons: can't easily access previous elemnst

Doybly linke dlist
Pros: can be traversed backearsd
Cons :takes 2x memory.

Implentaion Details:

Inserting the Singly linked list 

Graph :
Insert 11 where the third node

Inserting in Doubly linked lIst :

Inseting 11 where the third node is

Complexity Analysis:

Search : O(N)
INSERT AT HEAD: O(1)
INSERT AT TAIL : O(1)

DOUBY LINKED :
SERACH  : O(N)
INSERT AT HEAD OF TAIL : O(1)

REMOVE : SINGLY
head : O(1)
tail :O(n)
middle: O(n)

Doubly :
